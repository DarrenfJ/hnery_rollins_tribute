          <h2 class="robot">being a kid in a small town and discovering Hank</h2>
          <p>I suppose you hadda be a kid, in a small town in Northern Ontario, to get why discovering the music of Hank was such a thing. You had to be <em><a href="https://youtu.be/GR8acGv0Rzg" target="_blank">there</a></em> at that <em>time</em> to get
            it.
          </p>
          <p>I mean you have this music which is all about intensity and chaos, coupled with someone who is always saying 'you just have to get up and do it'</p>
          <p>'get focussed' 'do your thing' 'do it' 'and just do it fully'</p>
          <p>Of course this isn't a quote.. it's how I interpretted what he was saying.</p>
          <p>And if you were in <em>that</em> small town wondering what it all means and how you fit into a world you just didn't fit in to <small>(you know the whole round peg in a square hole thang)</small> finding Hank was like 'YES!'</p>
          <p>i wish i still had a little hank poem about coffee with some visuals i did for a graphics arts class once up on time. i would link it here..</p>
